## Overview
This project is in a very early stage of development, but will be continuously improved over time.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI Python backend with Selenium for Firefox browser automation
- Svelte web remote to control the system
  - Vite compiles Svelte files into the build folder, where they are served as static files by FastAPI
 
This project is not ready for use, and will likely require significant debugging to get set up (this will change with time)
My setup for this project is a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB, but any modern-ish Pi should work

Currently working on configuration scripts to set up the Raspberry Pi from a clean install

## Contributions
Contributions are not only appreciated but actively welcomed. 
This is something I've wanted to exist for a long time, so I figured I'd build it myself. 
If you have any ideas for improvements, feel free to make a PR :)
